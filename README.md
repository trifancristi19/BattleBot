# BattleBotBattleBot Purpie - BB027

Welcome to BattleBot Purpie - BB027! This project was developed as part of a BattleBot Race Challenge, where our bot had to complete the Line Race section of the maze.

👨‍💻 Coded by:

- Cristian Trifan

- Jia Men Lam

🚀 Project Overview

Purpie is responsible for the first part of the maze, called Line Race. It starts moving once an object is removed from its start position, detected using an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.

🏁 How Purpie Works

- Start Detection – Purpie waits for an flag to be raised from its start position (detected using an ultrasonic sensor).

- Line Following – Once started, Purpie follows the black line on the race track using line sensors.

- Obstacle Avoidance – Purpie avoids objects while staying on course.

- Drop Zone Detection – Purpie identifies a square zone where it should drop its carried object.

- Race Completion – After dropping the object, Purpie stops, allowing the next BattleBot to begin its journey.

🔧 Technologies Used

- Arduino – Core programming platform

- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor – For start detection

- Line Following Sensors – To navigate the maze

- Motors & Controllers – For movement and control
